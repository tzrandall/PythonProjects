# Python Projects

## This is a collection of Python projects to show as a portfolio. I will also include a brief explanation of each of the projects here.

## Virtual Dice
This was a final for a Python class in university (Fall 2021). The idea is that it is a virtual dice set that allows you to roll dice (with an auto sum of what the dice rolls are), repeat a previous roll (useful for things like D&D where you may roll 3 10-sided dice multiple times in a row), generate a history of rolls, and allow the user to view their preferred amount of history (e.g. last 3 rolls, last 10 rolls, etc.). I also added the history.txt that I had used for testing so you could see an example of the dice history with timestamp, sums, and what my rolls had been.
